# MCP Integration Task List

## Phase: MCP Server Integration for `chapter_emotion_arc.py`

### 1. Define the MCP API
- [ ] Identify endpoints and their functionality:
  - [ ] Input: Accept text files or raw text via HTTP POST.
  - [ ] Parameters: Rolling window size, output formats (CSV, JSON, Markdown).
  - [ ] Output: Return analysis results in the requested format.

### 2. Set Up the MCP Server
- [ ] Choose a Python web framework (e.g., FastAPI or Flask).
- [ ] Create server routes for:
  - [ ] Uploading files or sending text.
  - [ ] Triggering the analysis.
  - [ ] Returning results.

### 3. Integrate the Tool
- [ ] Refactor `chapter_emotion_arc.py` to:
  - [ ] Expose its functionality as a callable function or module.
  - [ ] Handle input from the server (e.g., raw text or uploaded files).

### 4. Handle Asynchronous Processing
- [ ] Research asynchronous processing tools (e.g., Celery, RQ).
- [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for large files.
- [ ] Store results temporarily and provide retrieval endpoints.

### 5. Add Logging and Error Handling
- [ ] Implement robust logging for debugging and monitoring.
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid input, processing failures).

### 6. Test the Server
- [ ] Write unit tests for server endpoints.
- [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end functionality.
- [ ] Test with various input sizes and formats.

### 7. Deploy the Server
- [ ] Choose a deployment platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
- [ ] Containerize the application using Docker.
- [ ] Deploy the server and verify functionality.

### 8. Document the API
- [ ] Provide clear documentation for users, including:
  - [ ] API endpoints.
  - [ ] Input/output formats.
  - [ ] Example requests and responses.

**Priority**: Start with defining the MCP API and setting up the server.
