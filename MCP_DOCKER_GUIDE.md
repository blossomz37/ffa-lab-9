# MCP Docker Integration Guide

## Current Status ✅

Your Docker setup is **working correctly** with the API server. The API server (FastAPI) is running and accessible at http://localhost:8000.

### What's Currently Running:
- **API Server** (lab-9-api-1): FastAPI server providing HTTP endpoints for emotion arc analysis
- **Dev Container** (lab-9-dev-1): Development environment with all dependencies

### What's Working:
- ✅ API health endpoint: http://localhost:8000/health
- ✅ API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ✅ Emotion analysis endpoint: POST http://localhost:8000/analyze
- ✅ All dependencies installed (including MCP package)

## Understanding the Architecture

You have **two options** for integration:

### Option 1: API Server (Currently Running) ✅
- Uses FastAPI to expose HTTP endpoints
- Works with any HTTP client
- Good for web integrations, testing, and general use
- **This is what you have working now**

### Option 2: MCP Server (Next Step)
- Uses Model Context Protocol for AI assistant integration
- Specifically designed for Claude, GPT, and other AI tools
- Better for AI-powered workflows

## Quick Commands

### Using Your Current Setup (API Server):

```bash
# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Analyze text
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I am happy but then sad.", "window_size": 3}'

# View API docs in browser
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Managing Docker Services:

```bash
# View running containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs lab-9-api-1 -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Restart services
docker compose up -d api

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose build api
docker compose up -d api
```

## Next Steps for MCP Integration

If you want to add MCP server alongside your API:

### 1. Start MCP Server with New Configuration:
```bash
# Use the new MCP-specific compose file
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d mcp-server
```

### 2. Or Start Both Services:
```bash
# Stop current services
docker compose down

# Start with MCP configuration
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d
```

### 3. Test MCP Server:
```bash
# Check if MCP server is running
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml ps

# View MCP server logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml logs mcp-server
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "port already in use":
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8000  # For API
lsof -i :9000  # For MCP

# Stop all Docker containers
docker compose down
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml down
```

### If services won't start:
```bash
# Clean rebuild
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### To completely reset:
```bash
# Stop everything
docker compose down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml down -v

# Remove all lab-9 containers
docker ps -a | grep lab-9 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f

# Rebuild and start
docker compose up -d api
```

## Testing Your Setup

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_docker_mcp.py
```

This will verify:
- Docker services are running
- API server is healthy
- Emotion analysis is working

## Integration with Your Tools

### For Web Applications:
Use the API server at http://localhost:8000

### For Command Line:
```bash
# Direct Python usage
python tools/chapter_emotion_arc.py sample.txt

# Through Docker
docker exec lab-9-dev-1 python tools/chapter_emotion_arc.py samples/sample.txt
```

### For AI Assistants (Future):
Once MCP server is running, configure your AI assistant to connect to localhost:9000

## Summary

You're not going in circles - your API server is working perfectly! The Docker setup is functional and ready to use. The MCP server is an additional option for AI integration, but your current API server already provides full emotion arc analysis capabilities.

**Your emotion arc tool is successfully dockerized and accessible via HTTP API!**
