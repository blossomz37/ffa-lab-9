# Claude Desktop MCP Integration Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your emotion arc analyzer is now configured for Claude Desktop. Here's what we've set up:

### What's Working:
1. **Standalone MCP Server** (`emotion_arc_stdio_server.py`) - Works without external dependencies
2. **Claude Desktop Configuration** - Added to your config file
3. **Local Testing** - Verified the server responds correctly

## Testing Your MCP Integration

### Step 1: Restart Claude Desktop
Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

### Step 2: Test in a New Chat
In a new Claude Desktop chat, try these commands:

```
"Use the emotion-arc-analyzer tool to analyze this text: 
I woke up feeling anxious about the presentation. But as I practiced, 
confidence grew. By the time I walked on stage, I felt unstoppable."
```

Or simply:
```
"Analyze the emotional arc of [paste your text here]"
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working
You should see Claude use your tool and return:
- Sentence count
- Average emotional valence
- Top emotions detected
- Valence progression over time

## How It Works

### Architecture:
```
Claude Desktop <--> stdio <--> emotion_arc_stdio_server.py <--> chapter_emotion_arc.py
```

### Your MCP Server:
- **Location**: `/Users/carlo/Lab-9/tools/emotion_arc_stdio_server.py`
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC over stdio
- **Tool Name**: `analyze_emotion_arc`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `text` (required): Text to analyze
  - `window_size` (optional): Rolling window size (1-50, default: 5)

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude doesn't recognize the tool:
1. Check if server is in config:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | grep emotion
   ```

2. Test the server manually:
   ```bash
   python3 /Users/carlo/Lab-9/test_mcp_local.py
   ```

3. Check server logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/mcp_emotion_arc.log
   ```

### If analysis fails:
1. Verify Python path:
   ```bash
   which python3
   # Should show: /usr/bin/python3 or similar
   ```

2. Test the underlying analyzer:
   ```bash
   python3 /Users/carlo/Lab-9/tools/chapter_emotion_arc.py samples/sample.txt
   ```

## Docker Alternative (Optional)

If you prefer Docker, you can still use the API server:
```bash
# API server is already running at http://localhost:8000
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your text here", "window_size": 5}'
```

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Analyze Any Text**: Copy/paste text into Claude Desktop and ask for emotional analysis
2. **Compare Versions**: Analyze before/after edits to see emotional changes
3. **Track Story Arcs**: Analyze chapters to understand emotional progression
4. **Customize Lexicons**: Edit the emotion words in `chapter_emotion_arc.py` for genre-specific analysis

## Files Created/Modified

- ✅ `/Users/carlo/Lab-9/tools/emotion_arc_stdio_server.py` - MCP server
- ✅ `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` - Added server config
- ✅ `/Users/carlo/Lab-9/test_mcp_local.py` - Local testing script
- ✅ `/Users/carlo/Lab-9/docker-compose.mcp.yml` - Docker config (optional)

## Summary

**Your MCP integration is ready!** 

The emotion arc analyzer is now available as a tool in Claude Desktop. You weren't going in circles - we successfully:
1. Created a working API server (still running)
2. Built an MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
3. Configured Claude Desktop to use your tool
4. Tested everything to ensure it works

Restart Claude Desktop and start analyzing emotional arcs!
