Chapter 3

Tyler Rhys moves first so Liz can breathe.

They inch along the access tunnel, belly-crawl, forearms sliding over dust-coated steel. Behind them, alarms still bleed muffled pulses through the walls, but distance and concrete turn the klaxons into a sick heartbeat. Liz’s breaths scrape, fast; he meters his own to a slow, steady rhythm she can borrow. One, two, three, hold. She copies him by the third cycle. Good. Keep her calm, keep her thinking.

The crawlspace dog-legs right, then slopes up toward a seam of pale light. A vent grate. Tyler braces, pushes—it gives with a squeal that sets his molars aching. He hauls himself out into a forgotten laundry sorting room that stinks of mold and detergent. He scans: no cameras, no microphones—just sagging shelves of uniforms and a rusted industrial press.

He reaches back, grips Liz’s wrists, and lifts her clear. She lands light, immediately pivots to shove the grate back in place. Fingerprints gone with one swipe of her sleeve. She’s already cataloguing exits, he can tell by the twitch under her left eye.

“Three minutes until the payload fires,” she whispers, voice shredded from adrenaline. “But they’ll lock the facility before the burst finishes. We need alibis.”

Tyler nods. He redirects the shake in his hands into action, retrieves two clean fatigues from the shelves, tosses one at her. “Laundry rotation,” he says. “We got stuck on supply run when the alarm hit.”

She wrenches the shirt over her head, musses her hair to match. Good improviser. She pauses, fingertips brushing the note in her breast pocket—he sees the flicker of fear before she kills it.

Boots pound in the corridor. Tyler’s muscles coil, but Liz steps into him, angles her shoulder so anyone looking through the door slit sees two prisoners folding laundry like good little assets. The footsteps pass. Ten seconds later, a second pair hurries by, radio chatter spitting about “breach origin uncertain.”

“Courier spike hits in two,” Liz murmurs. “If the checksum patch holds, the external node will think the payload is just packet noise.”

“How long to verify?”

“Ping loopback should bounce in an hour.” She blows hair from her eyes. “Survive that long and we’re heroes. Or dead.”

He almost smiles. “Redundant outcomes.”

Her lips twitch back.

The intercom crackles. “All subjects report for Phase Stability Evaluations immediately. Non-compliance will be punished.”

Liz curses under her breath. “Evaluation lab’s the opposite direction.”

Tyler shoulders past the door, checks the hall: clear. “Go. I’ll meet you after check-in.”

“You sure?”

“I need to cool off.” And he does—his blood thrums too loud, vision haloed at the edges. Blackout coming. He can feel it like weather behind a door. He can’t chance it in a lab full of electrodes.

She understands without argument—another sign of alliance soldering into something stronger. She slips north toward Medical. He heads south, toward Barracks Wing, the long way. Cameras sweep; he times the blinks like footsteps on an old staircase.

The tremor in his left hand worsens by the third turn. He flexes it into a fist, counts pressure points: thumb against middle finger, knuckle against palm. The nerves misfire anyway.

He reaches Dorm Wing B. Two guards block the entry, scanning badges. Normal procedure. His badge hangs at his collar; he touches it, nods. The senior guard squints. Tyler tilts his head, projects bored compliance. After Myrtle’s seizure, guards have itchy trigger fingers—any tension is an excuse.

“Phase eval’s other direction, asset,” the guard says.

“Laundry directive,” Tyler lies. “Sergeant Frost’s orders. Press malfunction.”

The guard frowns. Tyler catches his own reflection in the man’s visor—eyes dilated, sweat beading. Bad liar today. He clenches his hands behind his back before they see the tremor.

“Wait here.” The guard steps away to radio.

Bad. Time slipping; the surge behind Tyler’s eyes pushes forward, hot and metallic like rebar spearing his brain.

He pinches the tendon between thumb and index finger—pain spike, grounding. Thirty seconds, maybe, before the veil drops. He can’t collapse in front of them. Can’t wake to find blood on his knuckles and an innocent guard broken again.

The second guard leans close. “Asset, you look pale.”

“I’m fine,” Tyler grates. “Low blood sugar.”

A hum rises in his ears—vent fan? No. Wrong pitch. Same pitch from every blackout: three tones stacked like a chord out of tune with itself. The corridor torques, walls stretching.

He looks past the guard, locks onto a bolt protruding from a wall plate. Focus. Hex head, nickel-plated, slight rust bloom at the edges. Real, solid, human. Stay with it.

The first guard returns, radio clicking off. “No directive logged. You’re stalling.”

Tyler licks dry lips. “Maybe they forgot—”

“Hands on your head.”

The order slams into him like a gavel. Adrenaline floods, scrubs out the dissonant chord. For half a second he thinks he’s beaten the blackout.

Then his vision blanks white.

Static.

*

…cold, open water reflecting a sky split by three pale moons …  

…crowd of silhouettes kneeling in ash …  

…signal tower grown from bone and light …  

*

He comes back on his knees, palms planted on the floor, throat raw. Concrete tastes like copper. Above him the two guards lie crumpled in unnatural angles, rifles scattered. One moans, breath bubbling; the other doesn’t move at all.

Tyler staggers upright, horror packing his lungs so tight he can’t inhale. His knuckles are split. Blood speckles the wall: someone’s, maybe his.

He sets two fingers under the pulse point of the unconscious guard—beat sluggish but present. Relief jackknifes into his gut, followed by a fresh stab of guilt.

Footsteps. Closer this time. Tyler drags the bodies toward a janitor alcove, muscles crying. He props them semi-upright like they’ve fainted from heat. A laugh, hysterical, wants to claw out of his chest; he swallows it with bile.

Hallway mirror shows a spray of crimson across his cheek. He wipes it with his sleeve, smears it worse. No time.

He jogs—the only speed that won’t draw notice—back through Service Corridor Delta, bypassing the route watchers will lock down first. His heartbeat slams louder than the siren now spinning in the back of his skull.

Memory fragments from the blackout flicker: moons, bone tower, kneeling figures. None of it Earth. He blinks them into haze.

At Corridor G-6 a cluster of subjects moves in a nervous herd toward Phase Evaluations. Perfect cover. Tyler slips into the flow, keeps his chin down. Sweat cools on his spine.

As they queue at the biometric gate, his ID chip pings green. The guard on duty barely glances at faces, more worried about alarms. Good.

The exam bay reeks of antiseptic and panic. Rows of hospital beds, sensors dangling like spider webs. Techs shuffle, herding kids onto gurneys, slapping electrodes. Tyler scans for Liz—her dark messy bun stands out two rows over. She’s mid-argument with a junior medic, voice low but cutting. Good sign; she’s still thinking.

She spots him, eyes widening when she sees the blood on his sleeve. He shakes his head minutely: later.

A tech directs him to bed 14. He lies back. Cold gel electrodes squelch onto his temples. He focuses on the cotton acoustic tiles overhead—counting water stains. Two. Three. The tiles ripple, shape trying to emerge: outline of the bone tower. He blinks hard.

A nurse injects dye into his IV. “Hold still, asset.”

He stills. Band around forearm tightens. Heart monitor beeps too fast; he forces breaths long, even. The machine modulates down.

Across the bay, Liz pretends to gag on the dye. She’s buying seconds to hack the ECG console—he sees her fingers palming a fabric-wrapped probe she must have pocketed earlier. She taps the dielectric leads twice; he knows the trick: resets baseline noise, buys margin against anomaly flags.

Smart.

The evaluation takes seven painful minutes. Tyler’s brain feels like glass under a torch but the readings stay within tolerance, thanks to Liz’s sabotage. Release order prints. Nurse detaches him with a grunt, never seeing the tremble he hides behind a yawn.

As he sits up, dizziness nearly folds him. Liz intercepts him near the exit, linking her arm through his like they’re partners in a dance. Anyone watching sees mutual support; no one sees the way her nails dig crescents into his wrist—a code for we talk now.

They push through swinging doors into the recovery corridor, empty for the moment. She steers him into an unlit linen closet, kicks the door shut.

“What happened?” she breathes.

“Lost time,” he answers. Even in whisper the words taste like rust.

She switches on a pen-sized inspection light, sweeps it over his split knuckles. “God, Tyler.”

“No one dead.” He hopes. His voice breaks. He forces it steady. “Where are we on the payload?”

Her expression answers before her mouth does—a fierce, frightened grin. “Loopback ping came during eval. The Maple node acknowledges packet receipt. We did it.”

Relief should feel sweet; instead it ached dull in his bones. “So proof lives outside this tomb.”

“Yeah,” Liz says, but her eyes stay on his damaged hand. She pulls an antiseptic wipe from a supply box, cleans the blood. He winces; she doesn’t apologize.

“How long till Carroll realizes?” he asks.

“Hard to say. I buried the signal in their standard ops queue. Depends how paranoid his checksum auditors are.”

“He’s already paranoid,” Tyler mutters. “You saw the lockdown.”

“Exactly. Which means we need phase two before he can sanitize us.”

He flexes fingers as she wraps gauze. “Phase two?”

“Find hardware evidence. Physical schema of the integration unit, video of Myrtle’s threshold. Something you can’t claim was doctored.”

“Our backup cache is fried,” he reminds her.

“So we build another. But first—” She finishes tying the bandage, meets his gaze. “You need downtime. You’re running hot.”

He shakes his head. “No time.”

“Tyler, you blacked out in front of armed guards.” Her voice softens at the edges. “You don’t get to protect me if you’re fracturing.”

He looks away. Closet walls blink in peripheral vision, trying to birth alien moons again. Shame fists inside him, too big to swallow. “I almost killed them,” he whispers.

“You didn’t.” She cups the back of his neck, thumb smoothing the tension cord. The touch is brief but grounding. “That’s what matters.”

A bang in the hallway jolts them apart. Voices approach—guards canvassing. Liz kills the light, cracks the door. She peeks, waits, then slips out, tugging him after.

“Rec hall, fifteen minutes,” she murmurs. “We pretend to shoot hoops, map next move.”

He nods, melds into a passing group of subjects heading yard-ward. His pulse still sprints but he stays upright.

*

The rec hall is a repurposed artillery storage cavern with chain-net basketball hoops and a half-functional weight rack. Cameras line the ceiling; blind spots exist if you know the geometry. Tyler does.

He stations at the free-throw line, dribbles a scuffed ball. Each bounce echoes like a gunshot. He times the sound to his breathing, calibrates. Stay here. Stay human.

Liz jogs over, feigning a pass. “You look less murdery,” she says under the rattle of the net.

“Inside I’m a storm,” he replies, voice flat.

“Storms can be predicted.” She steals the ball, drives to the hoop, misses intentionally to justify their presence. On the rebound she murmurs, “Walker’s on south perimeter. Carroll in command. Dr. Aris is… missing.”

Fear flicks through him. “Walker took her?”

“Or she’s in a hole for stalling him.” Liz banks the ball, misses again. “Which means we’re down an inside ally.”

He volleys the ball back, hands steady now. “We have external proof. We leverage that, call for extraction.”

“How? Shortwave’s jammed. Sat comm locked to Carroll’s codes.” She wipes sweat from her brow. “We need a public channel big enough Carroll can’t bury. Something like the broadcast tower.”

“Too visible,” Tyler says. “They’d drop us before we hit the stairs.” He pivots, shoots from the arc. The ball rings iron, falls. He catches it one-handed—muscle memory from a different life.

Liz leans in, voice thinned to thread. “There’s something bigger than the tower: the emergency weather beacon on the seawall. It’s unmanned, automated, and patched to NOAA’s public band. If we feed it the Iceland packet—”

“It loops worldwide,” Tyler finishes. “Open frequency. Carroll can’t jam every antenna on the coast.”

“Exactly.” Her eyes spark with plan-energy despite exhaustion. “Only problem: seawall’s outside inner fence. And Walker lives for trespass denial.”

“We time it during shift swap.” Tyler cycles the ball under one arm, scanning the rafters. “And we need cutouts if one of us gets caught.”

Liz nods. “Redundancy.” The word tastes different when she says it—warm, almost fond.

A whistle blasts. Drill sergeant strides in, barking numbers for circuit training. They separate, blend into separate groups.

Tyler’s set starts with pull-ups. He grips the bar, shoulders igniting. Each repetition he counts not toward strength but toward penance—one for the guard with the broken wrist, one for his sister’s hospital bill, one for Myrtle’s black eyes. After fifteen, sweat stings his split knuckles. He drops, shakes arms, slides to the next station.

Station four: heavy bag. A corporal logs force metrics with a tablet. Tyler’s jab-cross combo rattles the chain. Data points climb—velocity, impact, fatigue. The corporal nods approval, unaware every strike is Tyler trying to punch the alien echoes out of his skull.

After circuits, subject assets file to hydration tables. Tyler swigs tepid water, wipes mouth, finds Liz in the line. She doesn’t speak, only taps her knuckle twice on the metal tabletop—a code they improvised: confirm meet as planned.

*

Late afternoon. Barracks Wing C, fifteen minutes to lights-out.

Tyler sits on the edge of his bunk, back to the wall, so the door window shows only his profile. The corridor beyond hums with last-minute guard rounds. He bandages his hand again—Liz nicked antiseptic from the rec hall first-aid kit, left it in his locker with a note: Use. Idiot.

He smears the gel, hissing. The skin around his knuckles throbs, but pain is welcome—proves he’s still here, still flesh. Not all signal and bone towers.

A soft vibration under his pillow—contraband burner comm, size of a poker chip, assembled from salvaged telemetry boards courtesy of Liz’s magic fingers. He taps it: one blink means message stored.

He toggles the micro-projector. Text spills across the pillowcase in pin-prick LEDs:

Maple node confirms successful receipt 17:03.  
Checksum verified.  
Payload quarantined for review by external sysop T-24h.  
—L

Twenty-four hours. They just have to last a day before some overworked Pentagon auditor opens a quarantine directory and shits his uniform. Twenty-four hours inside a cage run by a man who values them less than lab rats.

Tyler leans his head back, exhales. He wants to believe they can make it. Wants to picture Liz’s cynical half-smile when she gets the confirmation ping. Wants to picture a rescue helo splashing salt spray over the seawall while Carroll’s smug face collapses.

But the tower image returns—bone and light, moons watching. The sense of scale dwarfs helicopters, dwarfs oceans.

He fists the sheet. “Not your future,” he mutters. “Not if I have breath.”

Door clanks. Tyler snaps upright. Walker steps in, alone, closing the door behind him. The stainless lock slides; no witness.

Tyler stands, every muscle coiling. Walker’s face is placid perfection, the kind you see on mannequins. Eyes wrong—too dark, too still.

“Asset Rhys,” Walker says, voice calm enough to be mistaken for gentle. “You were observed outside prescribed routes this morning.”

Tyler says nothing. Silence is safer than lies.

Walker takes two measured steps. “Cooperation ensures survival,” he continues. “Deviation endangers project efficiency.”

Tyler’s fists flex, bandaged hand throbbing. “Your project kills kids,” he says, low.

Walker tilts his head, the motion eerily avian. “Null statement. Assets repurposed.”

Tyler’s pulse jumps. He could strike—one blow might crack that tranquil mask. But he’d break his hand on the metal under Walker’s skin. He’s seen the man stop a stun baton with bare fingers.

Walker studies him as though cataloguing data points. “Subject Salazar experienced unscheduled threshold anomalies. Director deems emotional contagion likely. Your proximity to Salazar—” he pauses, as if sifting through logs “—and to Asset Devereaux, suggests heightened risk of deviation.”

“I’m not contagious,” Tyler growls.

Walker’s lips part in an approximation of a smile. “We will determine that. Report to Medical at zero six hundred for supplemental assessment.”

“Can’t wait,” Tyler snarls.

Walker steps closer until Tyler can see the faint shimmer of something under the man’s skin—bioluminescent tracer maybe, or alien neurology pulsing in quiet triumph. Walker lowers his voice to a breath. “Contain your impulses, Asset Rhys. Or you will be contained.”

Tyler’s vision prickles, but not blackout—rage. He forces it down. “Yes, sir.”

Walker turns, unlocks the door, exits without another word.

Tyler’s knees sag after the latch clicks. Sweat chills. Zero six hundred. That’s tomorrow. Less than twenty-four hours. If Walker suspects Liz too, the timetable collapses.

He paces, mind grinding. Must warn her. He reaches for the comm, but hesitates—RF scans could detect burst transmission. Need face-to-face.

Lights-out buzzer shrills. Doors auto-lock. Too late tonight. First chow tomorrow, he’ll find her.

He sits, back to wall again, squeezes eyes shut—but the bone tower silhouette etches brighter. He grits teeth, focuses on the room’s sounds: ventilation tick, plumbing knock, distant gull. Human noises.

Eventually, exhaustion drags him into shallow sleep.

*

Dream:

He stands on black sand that feels warm despite the snow swirling overhead. Myrtle’s small form kneels beside him, head tilted back, eyes black voids. She sings in overlapping voices—too many throats for one body.

Ahead, the bone tower climbs into aurora, cables of light tethered to stars Tyler doesn’t recognize. Walker waits at the base, arms raised like a priest. Carroll skulks behind, face upturned in wonder, not control.

Liz stands apart, laptop open, fingers bleeding onto keys. She calls his name but it reaches him as metallic chirps—language of failing cicadas.

He steps forward; sand sucks at his boots; his hand weeps light where it was bandaged. As he raises it, the tower pulses—answering him.

When he wakes, the room is still dark. His hand glows faint blue for a heartbeat before reverting to skin.

Hallway speakers click on. “Morning wake-cycle in five.”

He flexes fingers. No glow. Delirium. But the memory stays.

Time to move.

*

Morning mess is electric with rumor. Alarms, mystery lockdown, whispers about two guards found concussed near Dorm Wing B—buzzed with sedative, to hush them. Tyler keeps his face neutral, spooning paste. Liz slips into the seat opposite, feigning indifference.

He leans, murmurs, “Walker scheduled me for assessment zero six hundred tomorrow. He suspects.”

“Then we hit the seawall tonight,” Liz answers, eyes on her tray.

“Visibility?”

“Thunderstorms forecast after lights-out. Cloud cover equals lower drone patrols.” She chews paste, grimaces. “I can spoof the fence sensors for ninety seconds.”

“Enough?”

“It’ll have to be.”

He nods, but dread roots deeper. Ninety seconds of open ground while Walker stalks the perimeter? Maybe. If his blackouts don’t detonate mid-sprint.

Liz kicks his boot under the table, meets his gaze. Her eyes hold more fear than she’ll ever say aloud—but also conviction. “Redundancy, remember,” she says.

He forces a breath. “Redundancy.”

A guard shouts for attention. Major Carroll strides into the hall, uniform crisp, smile gleaming shark-bright. “Assets,” he booms, “I commend your resilience during yesterday’s security drill. Your continued cooperation ensures the success of this unprecedented program.”

Subjects exchange uneasy glances. Tyler’s stomach knots over itself.

“Further evaluations will take place tonight,” Carroll continues. “Rest well during afternoon cycle. Tomorrow is a new dawn.”

His grin widens exactly three millimeters. Tyler counts. The same margin as always: practiced.

Carroll exits. Guards pace. Conversation resumes, hushed.

Liz stands, tray in hand. “Vent B2, maintenance hour,” she murmurs.

He watches her go, notes the slight stagger—she’s glitching again. Fear stings through him sharper than any wound. If she falls tonight, the mission dies.

He clenches his bandaged hand. No more slips. No more lost time. The alien chorus can howl; he will not let it puppeteer him again.

Tonight ends this.

At least, that’s the lie he chooses to believe as the mess hall hums with gull-cry and fluorescent buzz, and an invisible countdown ticks under every footstep.
