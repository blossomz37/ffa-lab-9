The mess line crawls forward, each shuffle of boots echoing in the concrete chamber like a countdown Liz can’t decrypt. Overhead, fluorescents buzz with that faint half-second latency she’s mapped in her head—white, white, micro-flicker, white. Someone tuned the ballast wrong. Sloppy work. Or a test. Everything here is probably a test.

She palms her tray, steps into the nutrient-paste queue, and catalogs weaknesses on reflex. Four cameras—two in plain sight, two tucked behind privacy glass. Guard rotation every seven minutes; Walker takes the north wall because he likes vantage. Carroll isn’t present, which means the mouthpiece speech is coming. He loves his speeches.

Salt rides the ventilation, dragged in from the Atlantic marshes outside the bunker. The place is sterilized, hermetically sealed—yet the ocean still bleeds through, tarnishing the lab smell with brine and decay. That contradiction sums Project Myrtle up perfectly: pretend-clean, rot underneath.

Myrtle Salazar stands three spots ahead, thin shoulders hunched like she’s expecting a blow. The kid can’t weigh more than ninety pounds soaking wet, yet the fatigues hang looser than yesterday. Liz notices because she notices everything others pretend isn’t their problem. Myrtle’s hands tremble. Not nerves. Something deeper, rhythmic—like code trying and failing to compile.

The drone behind the serving window slops gray paste into troughs. “Calories balanced for optimal cognitive restoration,” it chirps. Liz suspects the automaton was programmed by someone who’s never tasted food or irony. She slides past, doesn’t bother pretending the stuff is edible, and scans the room for anomalies.

Tyler Rhys is anomaly number one. He’s planted at the end of a steel table, back to the wall, eyes sweeping with that unhurried predator calm. Everyone gives him space. He doesn’t eat until the rest of the hall is half done; Liz logged the pattern her first week. She’s still deciding whether he’s dangerous or merely broken.

Her boots scuff the floor—too loud, damn it—and she slides opposite him. He doesn’t blink, just studies her, then the room behind her, then returns to sentinel mode. Fine. Conversation was never on her agenda.

Liz digs the rubbery spork into paste, pretends to chew, pretends she isn’t timing everything. Five seconds late, right on script, Major Carroll enters. The room stiffens. His uniform is immaculate, creases like scalpel lines. He smiles, the kind of smile built in a mirror.

“Good afternoon, assets,” Carroll announces, voice amplified by hidden speakers. “Progress metrics show encouraging adaptation. Keep embracing the program, and you’ll earn your second chance.”

Progress metrics. Adaptation. Second chance. Liz rolls the words on her tongue, tastes disinfectant.

Myrtle coughs—wet, guttural. Heads turn. Carroll continues, oblivious or uncaring.

“In the coming days you may experience minor disorientation. That is normal—proof the therapy is working. Report any concerns to medical immediately.”

Minor disorientation? Liz almost laughs. The headaches, the blank spots in her memory, the flashes of shapes she can’t name—those aren’t minor. They’re intrusion. She stabs the paste harder than necessary.

Myrtle’s tray clatters. Liz’s gaze snaps forward.

The girl’s eyes flutter. Irises dilate, slam shut, dilate again. A low sound leaks from her throat—wrong, glitchy, like radio static run through a child’s vocal cords. Then she speaks.

Not English. Not Spanish either, though Liz is rusty but would recognize the cadence. This is something else—choked syllables, consonants colliding at impossible angles. The air itself seems to recoil.

“What did she say?” someone whispers.

Myrtle’s knees buckle. Tyler rises halfway from his seat—protective instinct on autopilot—but hesitates, fists clenching.

A second voice pours out of Myrtle, overlaying the first, like two audio files unsynced. Liz’s heart bangs against ribs. She tries to parse the sounds, but they splinter in her head, fractal meanings she can’t grip.

Guards move. Two uniformed grunts rush the aisle, Walker a shade behind, pace unhurried. He reaches Myrtle as she drops, catches her under the armpits with surgical gentleness. For a breath the hall is silent except for Myrtle’s rasped syllables spin-looping in that non-language.

Then Myrtle convulses. Full body snap, like a marionette yanked by multiple strings. The tray hits the floor; nutrient paste splashes across Liz’s boots. She doesn’t move.

Walker makes no attempt to ease the seizure. He just restrains, efficient. Liz thinks his face is blank—but something in his eyes is almost… attentive. Not concern. Data collection.

Carroll steps aside, hands clasped behind his back, expression thoughtful, like a professor observing a successful experiment. He nods once. “Remove Asset Six for evaluation.”

“Yessir,” Walker replies, voice flatlined.

Myrtle’s fingers curl inward until knuckles crack. Blood pops from split skin and beads down her wrist. She jerks again, wails—no, not a wail. Words, still, but the meaning slides sideways in Liz’s brain. The sounds feel old, planetary, resonant in a bone-deep way that makes her stomach twist.

Liz’s tray vibrates. She realizes her hands are trembling, just a little. She locks them still.

Someone retches two tables over. A boy named Henders. Nobody looks at him; all eyes are on the horror in center stage.

Myrtle’s voice crescendos, a chorus of overlapping phonemes, until it cuts off mid-syllable. Her head snaps back, eyes wide, unfocused. In that instant she isn’t present—something looks out through her, an intelligence that recognizes the room but finds it irrelevant. Liz’s skin crawls.

The moment breaks. Myrtle slumps, unconscious or worse. Walker hoists her with effortless strength. Two guards flank him, rifles slung but ready; formality more than necessity.

As they haul the girl toward the exit, Myrtle’s head lolls in Liz’s direction. Her eyes are black—no whites, no iris, just ink. Liz jolts, breath caught. Then Myrtle blinks, and the eyes are normal again. Did Liz imagine it? The afterimage burns anyway.

Tyler’s chair scrapes, metal on concrete. He’s standing, shoulders squared in a posture that says Move Her Gently even if his voice doesn’t. Walker seems to register the unspoken command; his grip shifts to something almost tender.

Carroll clears his throat. “Resume your meal,” he orders.

Nobody obeys. Shock hangs heavy. The serving bot’s servo whines in the silence, ladle suspended midair.

“Asset Six is undergoing an expected threshold event,” Carroll explains, stepping into the slack air. “Therapy proceeds on schedule. Return to your seats.”

Expected? Threshold? Liz feels heat under her collar, a flush of anger slicing through fear. She opens her mouth, but Tyler’s eyes lock on hers—warning. She shuts it, jaw tight.

Walker exits with the limp girl. Doors slap shut behind them, oxygen whooshes from the hall like the room exhaled.

Carroll surveys his silent audience, smile returning. “Adversity is transformation,” he says softly. “Eat.”

He leaves. The doors hiss closed. The fluorescent buzz resets, white, micro-flicker, white.

Noise returns in sputters. Trays scrape. Someone sobs. Conversations ignite in frantic whispers. Liz pushes her untouched paste aside.

Tyler lowers back onto his seat, gaze fixed on the exit. His breath comes slow, measured, but the muscle in his jaw knots. He lifts a spoonful of paste, but it hovers, forgotten.

“Eyes back to your ration,” a guard barks. The hall obeys.

Liz forces her hands to stillness and counts camera sweeps. She can’t stop imagining word-strings Myrtle spoke, feel them slither under her thoughts like malware scripts probing for a port.

She spends the rest of the meal building firewalls in her head.

***

Later, corridors bleed antiseptic light as Liz files with the others toward barracks. Hallway 3B smells too clean—fresh bleach overlaying metal. Cover-up for the seizure? Probably.

She drifts to the rear of the pack, lets chatter mask her. Snippets float past:

“Did you see her eyes?”

“She was possessed.”

“No way I’m going to Medical if that’s what they call treatment.”

Liz notes each voice, each tone. Fear saturates the air thicker than bleach. Good. Fear drives mistakes; mistakes create openings.

Tyler walks near the front, shoulders taut. Twice he glances back, verifying something—maybe that Liz remains upright, or maybe he’s mapping threats. Hard to tell with that one.

A guard waves them through the biometric scanner into Dorm Wing C. Liz palms her ID chip against the plate. Green light. She steps into the corridor of reinforced steel doors, each with a narrow tempered window. The place used to be an artillery magazine—she’d unearthed historical schematics week one. High ceilings, thick walls. Perfect prison.

They’re herded into their cells. Doors clang; bolts slam. Liz exhales once the guard’s footsteps fade. She crosses to the tiny desk, flicks on the low lamp, and sits. Her hands finally shake openly.

She replays the scene frame by frame. Myrtle’s rapid collapse, the inhuman language—alien, has to be—and the black eyes glitch. A memory surfaces: her own last blackout, two days ago. She’d awakened on the floor, static in her ears, teeth aching. No recollection of lost minutes. She’d blamed exhaustion.

Now she isn’t sure.

Liz tilts her head back, stares at concrete ceiling, counts cracked lines. She does this to ground herself: numbers, patterns, something rational. When that fails, she mutters the access hierarchy of a Linux kernel, parental directories descending like a prayer. /root, /usr, /bin…

A distant clang somewhere down the wing disrupts the chant. She drops into silence, listens. Maybe a guard, maybe Tyler punching a wall. She can’t tell.

Focus. She needs data. If Myrtle was an “expected threshold,” then the baseline procedure is far worse than advertised. Liz’s parents had swallowed the rehab brochure: integrative neurotherapy, second chance, character reformation. She’d skipped the fine print because hacking three federal servers was going to land her in juvie or worse; Myrtle sounded marginally better. Temporary remote island, four-month program. She could endure that and be out before senior year.

Except now a fourteen-year-old is babbling cosmic glossolalia and bleeding from fingernails. Something’s rotting behind the firewall.

Liz stands, paces the four steps her room allows. She evaluates resources. Contraband flash drive: hidden in her sock hem. Pocket multi-tool: confiscated week one. Improvised weapons: desk lamp base could crush a camera, but that triggers a lockdown.

She needs evidence. Something more solid than fear.

Terminal access is limited to supervised sessions, but labs stay active overnight for automated diagnostics. Night shift is minimal; she’s mapped routes. The risk is… high. She hasn’t fully recovered from last slip past security, and punishment escalates. But after what she witnessed?

Not optional.

Decision crystallizes. She’s breaking in tonight.

Her pulse calms once the plan ladders step by step. She slots variables, contingencies, exit vectors. She calculates chance of success at thirty-two percent, but data beats ignorance.

An intercom crackles overhead. “Lights out in five.”

Liz wipes a hand down her face. She lies on the cot, stares at ceiling until fluorescence snaps to dim red nightlights. She counts thirty breaths, then sixty. Hallway remains quiet.

Time to move.

She slips off the cot, pads to door. The window shows corridor empty. Using a plastic strip peeled from mattress seam, she slides the interior panel—guard called the feature tamper-proof; he never met Liz. The lock contacts expose. A twist, a bridge with a hairpin, and the bolt thunks open. She exhales, cracks the door.

Footsteps distant. She ducks out, glides along wall. The red nightlights cast long shadows; cameras cycle, red LEDs blinking. She’s memorized their arcs. At junction Delta she rolls under a lens, heart hammering but limbs steady.

Every surface smells of bleach tonight, thicker the closer she gets to Medical. They’re sanitizing crime scenes. Perfect.

Two corridors later she hears voices—guards on break. She flattens to a maintenance alcove, holds breath. Words drift:

“Carroll says integrate rates ahead of projection.”

“Sure didn’t look like success today.”

“Director knows what he’s doing. Asset Assessment says Salazar crossed cognitive threshold. Next phase.”

The phrase Asset Assessment makes Liz’s stomach knot. She waits until boots recede, then slips onward.

She reaches the lab wing door—a thick keypad plus RFID reader. She digs the stolen ID of a junior tech from her sock, slides it. Red. Denied. She curses silently. Plan B: the keypad cover screws are cheap. She pries them with the hairpin, pops panel. Inside, colored wires pulse. She bridges green to yellow, grounds to frame. Door clicks. She’s in.

Cold air knifes her cheeks. The lab holds rows of glassed enclosures, machines humming lullabies of data. Consoles glow faintly—good; no full shutdown.

Liz keeps low, heads to station fourteen—she’d mapped its MAC address last week; it has deeper network privileges. She seats herself, cracks knuckles, and begins.

Root login requires biometrics she doesn’t have. She reroutes handshake through a spoofed admin token she coded in cell isolation. Fingers fly. Command line scrolls.

She requests patient logs on Asset Six. A directory manifests: brainwave telemetry, neurochemical treatments, integration sequence. She opens a progress report chart. Myrtle’s metrics spike into red three hours prior to breakdown—waveforms she doesn’t recognize, almost not human. The file tags them “Foreign Synchrony Event.” Liz’s skin prickles.

She tunnels deeper, hunting metadata. A hidden subdirectory labeled EXTERNAL_ORIGIN appears, locked. She smiles—challenge accepted. After three privilege escalations and a brute-force on a 128-bit hash, the folder yields.

Inside: ICELAND_ACQ_01.wav, ICELAND_ACQ_01.schem, ICELAND_ACQ_01.txt.

Iceland?

She queues the audio through local playback at two percent volume. A hiss, then layered tones—metallic shrieks overlapped with bass reverberations that make her teeth itch. The sound is uncanny, not random. Intent hums inside it. She kills playback, heart thudding.

Schematics open as a wireframe 3D hull—curved structure, alien geometry, annotations in military shorthand: “Recovered vessel fragment, Æsir site, Reykjanes Ridge.” Liz drags fingers across screen as if touch could verify reality. So the therapy isn’t therapy; it’s something pulled from a crash site.

She yanks a flash drive, slots it, initiates copy. Transfer bar creeps agonizingly.

Footsteps. She freezes. A silhouette slides across frosted glass of the hallway—Walker’s tall, unhurried gait. He’s alone.

Liz kills monitor brightness, drops behind tower. The transfer continues, LED blinking like a distress signal.

Walker’s pass card beeps at outer door. Airlock whoosh. He steps in. Liz hears his measured breathing over machine fans. She holds hers.

He moves with purpose, not random patrol. Maybe he got an alert. She curses—her intrusion might have triggered a flag. No time to abort copy; eighty percent.

Walker’s boots stop near her row. Silence stretches. Does he sense her? His presence feels heavier than just a man’s—like gravity.

Suddenly a crash resounds in the corridor beyond—metal skittering, a sharp clang, then cursing. Walker’s head jerks toward the noise. He pivots, strides out, door shutting behind him.

Liz’s lungs release. Who caused the diversion? She can guess: anomaly number one.

Transfer completes. She yanks drive, kills traces, reboots station to cover logs. Then she’s moving, retracing path. Adrenaline spikes make her limbs light, focus razor. She slips through keypad door, reseals panel, edges down hall.

At junction, she spots the overturned supply cart—the crash site. Boxes scattered, saline bags burst. No guards. A dark figure steps from shadow—Tyler, shoulders relaxed like mission accomplished. Their eyes meet.

In that glance, an understanding passes: he saw her, knew she needed cover, gave it. No words. He nods once, then walks away as guards round the corner shouting.

Liz ducks into ventilation alcove, heart a jackhammer. She waits out the commotion, then slinks back to Dorm Wing.

Inside her cell, door locked, she sinks onto cot, clutching the flash drive. She trembles with aftershocks, but victory taste is sharp, electric.

She plugs the drive into her contraband reader. Files intact. Proof.

But the win curdles when she replays Myrtle’s collapse in her head. Foreign Synchrony Event. If threshold events are inevitable, then she—everyone—approaches the same crash point. She presses fingers to her temples, as if that could hold her neurons in place.

A faint echo of Iceland audio seems to whisper from the drive even after she stops playback—imagination, or bleed-through?

Liz swallows, throat dry. The facility hums around her, indifferent. Out the small barred window she can’t see the sea, but she hears waves rasp against the cliffs, a reminder the outside world exists and is unreachable.

Myrtle is somewhere in Medical—maybe. More likely in a sublevel none of them even know about. Liz imagines the girl strapped to the Integration Unit, mind flayed and overwritten by whatever shrieked through that audio file. She shudders.

She forces herself to catalog facts:

1. The therapy source is alien technology recovered in Iceland.
2. Myrtle reached a “threshold” and collapsed.
3. Symptoms escalate—headaches, blackouts, foreign memories.

She has exhibits now. Not enough to convict, but enough to damn.

Tyler helped her, unasked. That matters. He’s not just brawn; he’s paying attention. She may need him.

Liz lies back, stares at ceiling until the fluorescents revert to day-cycle. Sleep never comes.

Myrtle’s eyes—black voids—linger behind Liz’s eyelids every time she blinks.

Whatever happened to Myrtle is already coding itself into their brains. It’s only a matter of when.

Liz clenches the flash drive until plastic creaks and whispers to the empty room, “Not me. Not without a fight.”
