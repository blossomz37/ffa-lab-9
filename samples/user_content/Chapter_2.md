Chapter 2

Liz spends the next two hours kneeling on the cold floor, her laptop balanced on an overturned trash bin that doubles as a desk. The contraband machine is a miracle of scavenged parts: a fan ripped from a busted ventilation unit, an SSD she’d smuggled in through intake—piece-by-piece, hidden behind loose stitching in her fatigues—a keyboard so thin it folds like paper. It whirs in a soft whisper now, screen brightness dialed to one percent. 

On her cot, she’s draped a gray blanket over the small barred window, blotting out the red glow of the corridor nightlights. Anyone passing will see only darkness. Inside the blanket fort, pixels bloom with forbidden knowledge.

Directory /EXTERNAL_ORIGIN/ expands. Each filename feels heavier than the last.

ICELAND_ACQ_01.wav  
ICELAND_ACQ_01.schem  
ICELAND_ACQ_01.log  
ICELAND_ACQ_01.mem

Mem? She hasn’t opened that one yet. The first three she’s scanned fast—just headlines, enough to confirm the obvious: crash site, military retrieval, classified beyond black. The schematics alone could land someone in permanent disappearing-act territory.

But the .mem file tugs at her curiosity harder than the rest. A compressed blob of binary nonsense that stubbornly refuses to decompress. She’s thrown three different de-archivers at it. No joy. Either the file is corrupted, or it’s encrypted with a schema so alien no human tool can parse it.

“Come on, talk to me,” she mutters, fingers flying. 

Her heart’s still punching adrenaline into her veins from the lab break-in. The audio file’s after-echo lingers in the room: static shrieks, sub-bass pulses that made her inner ear itch. Even at two percent volume the sound felt… invasive. As if something back-masked inside the noise tried to crawl through the speakers.

She checks the door—still sealed and hacked to show green on the corridor panel, so any guard glancing at it thinks the mag-lock engaged. A neat trick. Risky. Worth it.

She drops into hex view, scrolling through the .mem file byte by byte. There—every 512 kilobytes a repeating marker: 7F 45 4C 46. ELF header. Executable? Weird, considering the extension. Alien malware, maybe. She isolates one instance, runs it through a sandbox. The dummy environment hiccups, then freezes on 99 percent CPU. The virtual machine’s audio driver spikes briefly—producing the faintest mosquito-whine before the sandbox crashes.

Liz yanks her hands back as if burned. “Okay. You definitely don’t like being caged.”

She exhales, rubbing the heel of her hand over her brow. A migraine crouches behind her left eye—slept on since yesterday, now clawing out to say hello. 

She needs more processing juice than the junkyard laptop can give. She needs root access to the mainframe. She needs ten things she doesn’t have.

“Later,” she decides. She encrypts everything twice more, then kills the machine.

Silence rushes in. But not total silence. Footsteps shuffle down the corridor—lazy, night-shift boredom pacing. She slips the flash drive into a hollowed-out section of the cot frame, flips the laptop closed, and lies flat, blanket still draped over her like a tarp. Heart rate dips. Almost peaceful.

That’s when the flicker starts.

A filament of cold runs from the base of her spine to her frontal lobe. Light erupts behind her eyelids—like someone striking a magnesium flare in the dark. She gasps, palms flying to her temples.

Suddenly she’s not in her cell. She’s someplace endless. Black volcanic sand underfoot, fine as powder. Above, a sky blurred with green ribbons of aurora. Snow spins on a sideways wind, glittering like ground glass. 

And ahead—looming in total silence—lies a shape half-buried in the dunes. A slivered crescent of obsidian metal, fractured, bleeding blue-white sparks into the night. The hull pulses faintly, as though breathing.

Liz tries to pull back, but perspective yanks her forward, toward an aperture in the wreckage. Something waits inside, awake, aware, watching through faceted senses she cannot name. She tastes iron and ozone.

—wake up—  

She jackknifes off the cot, knees cracking the floor. Sweat chills instantly on her skin. The cell swims. A half-second lag before the world syncs, like a bad video buffering. 

Liz presses shaking fingers to her lips. “Not real,” she whispers, but the copper taste says otherwise.

A distant clank—doors cycling in Dorm Wing C. Patrol. Move.

She shoves the blanket aside, straightens the cot, hides the laptop beneath the thin mattress. By the time a guard’s shadow darkens her window, she’s curled on her side, eyes closed, breathing slow.

The shadow lingers. She counts beats—three, four, five—before it drifts away.

Only then does she let adrenaline release its claws.

She’s still panting when a quiet double-tap sounds at her door. Two light knocks. No follow-up. 

Tyler’s signal.

Liz sits up, every joint complaining. She slides the lock contact back into place, eases the door open a hair. Tyler occupies the hallway’s gloom—tall, still, expression unreadable in low red light. One hand holds a folded scrap of paper; the other hovers near something tucked into his waistband. A deterrent, not a threat.

“You up?” he rumbles, voice pitched low.

“Obviously.” She steps into the hall, closes the door behind her. “What?”

He glances both directions. “Vent shaft by Boiler Two. Dead camera, loud fans. We talk there.”

She opens her mouth to snark but shuts it; sarcasm feels fragile after that vision. “Lead the way, muscle.”

He turns, boots whispering on the concrete. She follows, every footstep measured to avoid echo. Down the corridor, past the communal washroom that reeks of bleach and mold, into an auxiliary maintenance passage where the walls sweat condensation. The low hum of industrial fans builds.

They reach a grated hatch slotted at floor level. Tyler kneels, fingers finding bolts already loosened. He removes the grate silently, gestures her inside. She slips in, sits with knees to chest amid swirling heat. He follows, replacing the grate. Turbine roar climbs; the metals walls tremble. Nice cover.

The shaft is narrow—barely three feet deep before the duct angles upward—but it’s shielded from cameras. Warm air rushes past, carrying damp salt and furnace stink. Liz braces her back against one wall, Tyler opposite. Their knees almost touch.

For a moment neither speaks. The fan noise pounds like ocean surf inside a drum.

Finally Tyler slides the folded paper across the little space. “Saw you drop this.” 

She takes it—recognizes immediately: the corner of a medical requisition form she’d used as scratch paper to jot a chain of addresses during her hack. She’d thought she burned it. Apparently not.

“Where’d you find it?” she asks.

“Stuck to the wheel of that cart I tipped.” He shifts, gaze steady. “Looked important.”

More than important. If Carroll’s security analysts found that scrawl—IP blocks, user credentials, one partial directory path named EXTERNAL_ORIGIN—they’d backtrace straight to her terminal session.

“You covering for me?” she asks, tone light but eyes sharp.

“Seemed fair.” He rolls a shoulder. “You were covering for all of us, right? Whatever you did in there.”

The implication warms her chest with something like embarrassment. She defaults to teasing deflection. “Always the noble bruiser.”

His lips twitch—something close to humor. “More practical. You looked like you knew why the kid spasmed.”

“Myrtle. Her name’s Myrtle,” Liz corrects, then regrets the edge in her voice. 

Tyler dips his head. “Myrtle.”

Liz unfolds the scrap, tears it to confetti, lets the fan suck the pieces down the duct. Evidence gone. “Thanks,” she says, and means it.

He studies her. In the half-light his scarred eyebrow looks deeper, a pale slash. “What did you find?” 

Liz bites the inside of her cheek. Sharing equals risk. But Tyler already risked punishment to cover her. And after that… episode… she’s not sure she can untangle this alone.

“There’s a file.” She scans the duct, out of habit. Only whirling darkness. “Audio, schematics, logs. From Iceland. Crash retrieval.”

Tyler’s brow furrows. “Crash? Plane?”

“Not unless Boeing started making starships.” She waits for disbelief. None comes. His stillness has gravity. An open socket, waiting for data.

So she gives him the highlight reel, words quick like code compiling. The alien hull fragment. The audio’s teeth-on-bone frequencies. The cryptic memory file that kills sandboxes. The term FOREIGN SYNCHRONY EVENT stamped on Myrtle’s chart. She skims past how she got it, focusing on what it means: the therapy is integration with something non-human.

She expects him to scoff—or freeze. Instead, he processes. That watchful stillness again, like he’s taking the data apart, bit by bit.

Finally he asks, “You believe it?”

A knot in her neck snaps as she nods. “I believed the moment Myrtle spoke.”

Tyler’s gaze flicks away, down the cramped duct. “She looked… emptied out.”

The phrase slices Liz open with an image: Myrtle’s black void eyes. She shivers, hugging herself.

Tyler notices. His posture shifts: shoulders relax, knees splay a little wider, making room. A protective rearrangement as instinctive as breathing.

Liz’s pulse stutters. She’s not used to anyone making room for her.

“Look,” he says, voice gentler. “You got the proof. What’s the plan?”

She laughs—too sharp. “Plan was survive past breakfast. You were a variable.”

“I’m good at breaking variables,” he says, almost wry.

She meets his eyes. They’re dark, steady, not accusing. “You want in?”

“Not want.” He scratches his knuckles against the duct wall, metal rasping. “Need. Whatever’s in me—it’s waking up.”

The raw admission startles her. “Symptoms?”

He hesitates. “Blackouts. Since week two. Getting worse.”

Her chest tightens. That earlier blank-space vision—how long until she blanks entirely? “Me too,” she whispers before she can stop herself. “Just now. Saw… snow, sand. The crash.” 

He angles closer. “Like a dream?”

“Too crisp. And too cold.” She rubs forearms. “Our brains are being overwritten.”

“Then we fight.” The words land like iron. No bravado. Just fact.

The shaft rattles as an intake cycle revs, buffeting them with a wave of furnace heat. Liz wipes sweat from her temple. “Fighting means evidence strong enough to reach past Carroll’s firewall. I’ve got bytes, but we need redundancy. Somewhere internal and external.”

“Server backups?” Tyler asks.

She nods. “And we have to stay ahead of Walker.”

At the name, a tension threads Tyler’s shoulders. “He’s wrong inside. I felt it when he touched Myrtle.”

Liz recalls that almost-tender grip. “Like he’s running a different OS.”

They lapse into silence, letting the fan swallow fears. Somewhere overhead, water pipes groan.

Liz breaks first. “Why’d you help? Tonight. You don’t even know me.”

Tyler studies his calloused hands. “I saw you watching everything. Taking notes nobody else sees. Figured you’d try something stupid sooner or later. Better odds I help than watch you get dragged away.”

“You assume I need muscle.”

He shrugs. “Assume systems need backups. I’m a redundancy.”

The corner of her mouth lifts despite the dread. “Redundancy with biceps.”

His shoulders rise in a tiny laugh. “Something like that.”

The moment hovers—charged, precarious. The duct’s heat wraps around them, humid. Liz becomes aware of how cramped the shaft is, how his knees brush hers when the fan gusts. She should feel trapped, but the proximity steadies her pulse. His presence, big and solid, acts like grounding lines on a server rack.

First spark. She recognizes it, tries to smother it. Emotions equal vulnerabilities. But the spark lights anyway.

A distant PA crackle breaks the moment. “Night-cycle complete. Morning drills commence in thirty minutes.”

Tyler tenses. “Shift change. We should split.”

“Yeah.” She reaches to remove the grate, fingers brushing his. Static pops. She jerks back. He withdraws at the same instant—mirrored caution.

Together they crawl out. The corridor nightlights have shifted from red to weak amber. Footsteps echo far off—guards changing posts. No immediate eyes.

Liz turns to him. “Keep low. And—thanks.”

Tyler nods. “You too.”

She spins toward Dorm Wing C, but his voice stops her. “Liz.”

Hearing her name from him jolts something warm down her spine. She meets his eyes.

“Don’t go back in the lab alone,” he says. “Next time, you take redundancy.”

She almost quips that she’s perfectly capable, but the vision’s aftershock still quivers in her nerves. “Copy that,” she says instead.

He heads the other way, shoulders squared, boots soundless. Liz watches until he rounds the bend, then slips to her cell.

Inside, she bolts the door, leans against it, and exhales all the air she’s been holding since the seizure in the mess hall. Her hands tremble openly now, but she doesn’t stop them. Instead, she forces them to type—booting the contraband laptop again. She may be shaking, but there’s work.

She pulls up a blank file and begins drafting a threat matrix. Parameters: Carroll’s authority, Walker’s patrol schedule, unknown alien fail-safes. Asset status: Myrtle—critical, unknown condition. Tyler—ally candidate with escalating blackout risk. Liz—primary operative, cognitive integrity compromised.

Under Actions, she types:

1. Secure multiple copies of ICELAND_ACQ_01.  
2. Map server architecture for remote broadcast.  
3. Establish surveillance dead spots for rendezvous (Vent B2, Laundry heat tunnel, Storage Delta).  
4. Monitor personal symptom progression—track time gaps.  

She hesitates, then adds:

5. Trust Tyler Rhys (conditional).

Her fingers hover over the keyboard longer than she likes, but the word stays.

A sudden nausea grips her—vertigo, like the floor tilting. She slams the laptop shut, rides out the wave. The crash vision tries to bleed into present, edges of her vision frosting with static.

She drags in a breath, forces herself to focus on the single bare bulb overhead. The nausea recedes.

“Not yet,” she mutters. “You don’t get to pilot yet.”

She paces, counting steps: one, two, three, pivot. On the fourth pivot she notices something under her cot—white paper, slid partway into view. Impossible; she performed a sweep.

She crouches, retrieves it. A folded note, edges crisp. Two words inside, printed by typewriter or dot-matrix:

WE REMEMBER

No signature, no header. The letters shimmer faintly, ink not quite black, as if printed from a ribbon soaked in oil.

Her heart kicks. Did Tyler leave it? No. No time. And the phrase—plural first person?

Liz flips the note over. Blank. She sniffs the paper: faint ozone, same as the lab.

She drops it like it’s hot. It flutters to the steel floor.

Her pulse hammers in her throat. She surveys the room—no vent large enough for someone to slide this in without opening the door. Only way is under the door. During patrol? During blackout?

She crouches, eye to gap. A sliver of corridor shows, empty.

The note lies between her boots, a declaration she can’t decrypt.

Adrenaline’s back. She picks it up with fingertips, slips it into a binder clip inside the cot frame, next to the flash drive. Out of sight.

She forces herself to lie down. Dawn shift buzz already vibrates through the walls. In fifteen minutes, doors will unlatch for calisthenics in the yard.

She has to get through drills without spacing out, without letting the alien memory loops bleed through. She has to hide her shaking. She has to think.

But as she stares at the ceiling, one phrase loops, overriding all other processes:

We remember.  

We remember.  

We—

A buzzer blares. Doors unlock in a chain reaction of thunks. Liz swings her legs off the cot, slaps her cheeks twice, and dons her mask of cynicism.

Time to boot up for another day in the breach.

***
Morning fog cloaks the yard, a damp shroud that condenses on every surface. Liz joins the line of subject assets jogging in silence along the cracked tarmac perimeter. Guards pace the inner ring, rifles slung, breath steaming in the chill. Above, gulls wheel against an iron sky.

Her lungs ache by lap two—both from exertion and the residual ozone taste that clings to her sinuses. Each time her boots strike the ground, an image of black sand overlays the pavement, pixelating reality for a half-second before snapping back.

Tyler runs three bodies ahead, pace steady, shoulders rolling like a machine. At the northwest corner he glances back, catching her eye. Just a flick, but it steadies her stride.

Carroll stands near the main gate, hands clasped behind him, watching the herd circle. His smile is professional but distant; Liz imagines overlaying cross-hairs on his forehead. She files that away for later.

She completes the mandated four laps, then guides herself to the stretching zone, where a medic takes pulse readings. Liz schools her expression, hoping adrenaline masks anomalies in her heart rhythm. The medic waves her on. She exhales.

Breakfast queue next. Same nutrient paste, same fluorescent flicker. But the table arrangement has changed: Myrtle’s usual seat now sits empty, tray removed. A tiny erasure in the algorithm. Liz’s pulse stutters but she keeps moving.

Tyler appears beside her at the utensil station—silent, looming. He palms two spoons, slides one toward her, casual. On the plastic handle, in scraped letters, he’s etched three numbers: 22.3.17.

She nods minutely. The coordinates of Storage Delta—one of her planned rendezvous dead spots. He’s already thinking ahead.  

They part. Liz carries her tray to a table beneath a faulty camera whose feed she knows loops every eighteen seconds. As she sits, the glitch hits again—just a blink: snowfall over trays, aurora slicking fluorescent bulbs. She clenches her jaw until the cafeteria reasserts itself.

One second lost. Maybe two. She hopes no one noticed.

Conversations swirl around her—nervous analysis of Myrtle’s seizure, rumors about increased dosage, the usual speculation about release dates that will never arrive. Liz spoons paste mechanically, eyes scanning for patterns: guard rotations, camera sweeps, which subjects are sweating more than usual.

A tray slams down across from her. She looks up. Tyler. He doesn’t speak. He just eats, motions small and precise. Every ninety seconds, his gaze glides over her shoulder, checking the guard line. He’s shielding her with his presence, a wall of muscle that obscures her from half the hall.

Liz focuses on calibrating her breathing to his tempo—inhale when his spoon rises, exhale when it lowers. The synchronization slows her racing thoughts.

She considers sliding the note across for him to read, but cameras are everywhere. Instead she drops her voice, eyes on her tray.

“Free period?” she asks.

“Gym, phase testing,” he murmurs.

“The usual monkey-bar contest?”

“Yeah. Audience this time—Carroll wants fresh metrics.”

Liz nods. Phase testing means electrodes, heart monitors, baseline evaluations to gauge how well their new ‘therapy’ is sinking its claws. Might be a chance for sabotage. Or a chance to be discovered.

“Storage Delta, second bell,” she says, barely moving her lips.

He taps a finger once on the table—yes. Then stands and walks away, tray half-finished. As he approaches the exit, Walker steps into his path. The head of security’s expression is unreadable, but for a moment they face off—statue against statue.

Tyler doesn’t flinch. Walker’s gaze slides past him, scans the hall, then settles on Liz for one chilling heartbeat. She forces a bored yawn.

Walker turns and strolls away, boots clipping like metronome ticks. Tyler follows guards out.

Liz exhales. She gathers her tray, deposits it, and makes for the barracks. Free period starts in ten. Enough time to retrieve a second flash drive she hid behind a loose electrical conduit.

As she rounds the corner into a maintenance passage, fluorescent bulbs flicker—bright, off, bright. Her vision ghosts again: wind painting dunes with snow. A voice, layered, inside her skull:

—we remember the burn the fall the cold we remember—

She bites the inside of her cheek hard enough to taste blood. The voice recedes.

She reaches the conduit, pries it open, retrieves the drive. Fingers numb. She slips it up her sleeve, reseals the cover. When she turns, a petite figure in scrubs stands three feet away—Dr. Aris.

Liz’s stomach drops.

The neuroscientist’s eyes look bruised, her hair pulled back in a haphazard knot. Clipboard clutched to chest. 

“Asset Devereaux,” she says, voice low. “You’re due in exam suite seven at eleven hundred hours.”

“Didn’t see it on my schedule,” Liz replies, forcing casual. Her mind races—does Aris know about the hack?

“The schedule changed.” Aris’s gaze darts down the corridor, then back. “Please be prompt.”

Liz tilts her head. A micro-lie forms. “I was hoping to finish morning PT before any poking.”

Aris steps closer, urgency radiating. “Eleven hundred,” she repeats, then lowers her voice to a whisper Liz barely catches: “Don’t be late. Bring…the instability.” She touches her temple quickly, a gesture halfway between itch and signal.

Then she retreats down the hall, shoes squeaking, shoulders hunched.

Liz watches her go, pulse thudding. Instability? Does Aris mean the flash drive? The symptoms? Is this a warning or a trap?

She turns, hurries for the main hall. Questions stack like bad code. She needs Tyler. She needs countermeasures. She needs to not pass out in front of Carroll’s pet doctor.

But one thing crystallizes: Dr. Aris is tangled in this deeper than a simple lab coat fall guy. Whether threat or reluctant ally, Liz can’t tell.

Yet.

***
Storage Delta hides behind a dented steel door at the far end of the laundry tunnels, past rumbling industrial dryers whose roar scrambles audio mics. Liz slips inside at the appointed time. The room is narrow, lined with wire racks of surplus fatigues and buckets of disinfectant tablets. A single bulb casts jaundiced light.

Tyler arrives seconds later, closes the door, slides a mop bucket against it as casual barrier.

“Exam at eleven,” Liz blurts. “Aris requested me. Not in system.”

He frowns. “That’s soon.”

“I know. She said ‘bring the instability.’ I don’t speak cryptic scientist.”

Tyler crosses arms. “Could be trap.”

“Or she’s trying to help.” Liz paces. “Either way, I’ll have eyes on me.”

“I’ll tail the escort team,” he offers. “If it goes wrong—”

“You what? Punch Walker through a wall?”

“If I have to.”

The earnestness steals her breath. She stops pacing, faces him. “You’re risking containment breach. One wrong move—”

“I can’t let them take you blind,” he says. “We work together or we both end up like Myrtle.”

Her chest constricts. The room seems smaller, the air warmer. She swallows. “Okay. Backup plan: If they separate us permanently, we dump everything to secondary storage. Maple Cluster.”

His brow arches. “Maple Cluster?”

“Old telecom relay on the mainland. I can bounce a signal off a maintenance satellite—long story. I’ll need at least a minute at a secured terminal.”

“I can buy you a minute,” he says.

She doesn’t doubt it. But the thought of him throwing fists at armed guards—collateral damage, blood—claws her gut.

“Let’s not need that,” she says softly.

He nods. Steps closer. Close enough she smells starch on his uniform, a hint of machine oil. “You got this,” he murmurs.

A pulse of dizziness hits her. She wobbles. Tyler’s hand shoots out, steadies her arm.

“You okay?”

The touch grounds her in the here-and-now. She inhales shaky air. “Yeah. Lag spike.”

He doesn’t release her immediately. Fingers warm around her elbow. When he does let go, the absence stings.

First spark turns to ember.

She clears her throat. “I should go prep.”

He glances at the scratchy wall clock. “Five minutes.”

They move the bucket, crack the door. Before slipping out, Tyler speaks: “Remember breathing. Keeps the glitches shorter.”

She gives half a smile. “Look at you, hacker health coach.”

“I pay attention.” He flicks her a two-finger salute—almost playful—then merges into a passing group of trainees heading for PT.

Liz heads opposite, toward Medical, mind racing. Each step echoes with the note’s phantom words: We remember.

Outside Exam Suite Seven, two guards wait. They usher her in without comment. Inside, fluorescent light blazes. A reclining diagnostic chair sits center stage, draped with sensor wiring. Monitors hum.

Dr. Aris stands beside the chair, eyes rimmed red, hands trembling. She closes the door behind Liz, latching it. For a beat they just stare at each other.

Aris’s voice barely above a breath: “How much have you accessed?”

Liz weighs lies. Chooses the knife-edge truth. “Enough to know Myrtle wasn’t a glitch.”

Aris flinches at the name. Her gaze darts to the walls, corners—checking for cameras, mics. “This room’s shielded,” she says. “For now.”

She steps to a trolley, retrieves a sealed syringe. Blue liquid glitters inside.

“What’s that?” Liz demands.

“Sedative façade. They expect me to take samples, administer ‘adjustments.’” Aris uncaps the needle, squirts a thin jet into the sink. All of it. Then tosses the empty into a disposal chute. 

“I have very little time,” Aris whispers. “He’s accelerating the thresholds. Your pattern—Devereaux, you’re next.”

Liz’s mouth dries. “When?”

“Days. Maybe hours if your stress markers spike. Carroll sees your cognitive dissonance as ideal host pliability.”

Liz’s knees wobble. She rounds the chair, scanning displays—biometric graphs labeled ASSET-3B. Heart rate, EEG, blood oxygen. “Then help me stop it.”

Aris’s eyes glisten. “I’ve tried. My sabotage only slows things — he has redundancies.” She shudders. “But you… You might expose him outside.”

“That’s the goal.”

The doctor inhales raggedly. “There’s a secure courier line in the sub-basement. Encrypted fiber. Carroll uses it for data bursts to command.” She slips a slim silver asset tag from her pocket. “This gives level-four access for thirteen minutes before revocation.”

Liz takes it, thumb brushing metal still warm from Aris’s hand. “Why me?”

Aris swallows. “Because I can’t live with it anymore.”

Suddenly, muffled shouts in the corridor. Liz stiffens. Aris points to a side door. “Service ladder. Go. I’ll stall.”

Liz hesitates. “They’ll know you helped.”

“I know.” A broken smile. “Asset Six was my niece.”

The words hit like a fist. Liz’s eyes burn. She palms the tag, mouths thanks, and slips through the side door.

Metal ladder descends into gloom. As she climbs down, alarms blossom above—doors banging, voices barking. Aris buying time.

Thirteen minutes. She hits the concrete floor, sprints along a maintenance tunnel lit by weak safety LEDs. Map flashes in her mind: sub-basement fiber hub beneath The Sanctuary. Two checkpoints, one biometric lock. She now has a level-four tag. Maybe enough.

Her radio of a brain crackles: snow, black sand, aurora. She bites her tongue, keeps moving.

At the first security junction she swipes the tag. Green light. Door pops. Ahead, a wider corridor—unpatrolled for the moment. But footsteps echo distantly.

Twelve minutes.

She races, lungs burning. At the second checkpoint a single guard looms. He turns, surprised. Liz’s pulse skyrockets. She fumbles for a distraction.

From down the hall, a roar—Tyler’s voice, deep, furious: “Hey!”

The guard whirls, sees an eighteen-year-old freight train charging. He raises his baton. Tyler slams into him shoulder-first, flinging him into the wall. The guard crumples, out cold.

Tyler looks at Liz, breathing hard. “Minute bought.”

She can’t waste it. They drag the unconscious guard behind a storage crate. Liz swipes the tag at the biometric lock. The door slides open to reveal a server alcove humming with blue lights. Fiber trunk lines snake into a console labeled OUTBOUND NODE 3.

Nine minutes.

Inside, Liz drops to the keyboard, hands lightning. Root login requests retina — she jams the tag into override slot. Access granted. Directory tree blossoms. She opens an encrypted session, points at Maple Cluster’s dormant address, sets up an outbound handshake piggy-backing on Carroll’s next scheduled burst in—she checks—seven minutes.

She can ride the same line with a data parasite hidden in checksum noise. She copies the Iceland files, starts compressing. Status bar crawls.

Behind her, Tyler paces, ears tuned for pursuit.

“Niece?” he asks.

Liz’s throat tightens. “Myrtle.”

Tyler’s jaw flexes. “Focus,” he says.

She does. Compression at forty percent. A hitch—data mismatch pops. She rewrites header bits manually, restarts pack.

Footsteps approach. Tyler grabs a fire extinguisher, stands ready. Liz’s heart jackhammers.

Compression hits ninety-nine percent. Transfer queue lights green. She embeds the payload in the upcoming burst, sets execution to auto at transmission time. Five seconds later, confirmation ping.

“It’s in the pipe,” she breathes. “Outside world gets the truth in six minutes.”

Sirens erupt. Red lights flash. Door behind them locks with a metallic slam.

Tyler spins. “Breach protocol.”

Liz’s laugh borders on manic. “Yeah, we breached.”

Tyler surveys the room—vents too small, no alternate exits. He raises the extinguisher. “Stand back.”

He smashes the nozzle into a side panel, sparks flying. A  service hatch buckles. He rips it open, revealing an access crawlspace.

“After you,” he says.

Liz crawls in, clutching the flash drive for comfort she shouldn’t need. He follows, replacing the panel behind them, plunging the tunnel into darkness.

As they inch forward, alarms fade. Only their breath and distant machinery remain.

Ahead, a faint glow—vent slats leaking corridor light. Tyler pulls parallel, whispers: “Redundancy worked.”

Liz thinks about Aris’s sacrifice, Myrtle’s void eyes, the note that claimed We remember. And the alien cold surfacing in her skull.

“Phase one,” she says. “Now we survive until the signal lands.”

They crawl onward, together, into shadows that smell of rust and salt and possibility.
